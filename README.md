## Introduction

Credit card approval is a crucial decision-making process for financial institutions. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a customerâ€™s credit card application should be approved or denied, based on a variety of demographic and financial features. The goal is to assist banks in automating approvals while minimizing risk and maximizing accuracy.

## Dataset

* **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Credit Approval Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)
* **Features**: Includes attributes such as `Age`, `Employment Status`, `Total Bill Amount`, `Annual Income`, and more.
* **Target Variable**: `default_payment` (1: defaulted, 0: non-defaulted).

---

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**

   * Explored distributions and relationships among key features (age, gender, education, payment history).
   * Visualized correlations and feature importances to guide modeling.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Null value imputation
   * Categorical encoding (label mapping)
   * Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   * Feature engineering (e.g., total bill, total payments)

3. **Model Building:**

   * Trained multiple classifiers to optimize predictive accuracy.

---

## Machine Learning Models Used

* **Logistic Regression:** Baseline linear model for binary classification.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Non-linear model for capturing complex patterns and feature interactions.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** Ensemble method for improved robustness and generalization.

Each model was tuned and evaluated on a hold-out test set.

---

## Evaluation

* **Performance Metrics:**

  * Accuracy
  * ROC-AUC Score
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Feature importance analysis
* **Visualization:**

  * ROC curves for model comparison
  * Feature importance bar plots
  * Exploratory data visualizations

---

## Results

* **Best Accuracy:** Up to \~88% on the test set.
* **Insights:** Random Forest and Logistic Regression models showed strong, consistent performance. Key features impacting approval included payment history, credit limit, and recent bill amounts.
* **Interpretability:** Feature importance plots provided clear business insights for decision-making.
